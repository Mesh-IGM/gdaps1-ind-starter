This is a template project for students to use in GDAPS 105 to track demo and practice exercise code.

# Getting Started

Get your favorite Git client:
* [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/)
* [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

### Why are we using Git?

Some of you may be thinking: "Why are these silly people making me use _source control?!_"

Well, there are a ton of reasons.

Basically every software company uses some sort of source control throughout the
development process. It's an incredibly powerful tool that you should learn
to master in the same way that Arya Stark wields Needle.

Using Git for homework assignments will also make things easier throughout the grading process, as we can
automate the downloading/updating of your work. Yay for workflow improvements!

For practice exercises (this repo), even though we'll grade in person, using git means that you can share your progress with us and get help remotely!
